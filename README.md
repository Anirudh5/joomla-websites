## Report a Problem with an official Joomla! Project Website

If you need to report a problem with one of the Joomla website owned by the project, for example: Joomla.org, please use one of the following links to create an issue. You will need a GitHub account to report an issue. If you don't have one you can **[create](https://github.com/join)** one.

To help the webmasters, please:

1. **DO NOT report security issues here, report them to the [Joomla Security Strike Team](http://developer.joomla.org/contact-security-team.html)**
2. Use a descriptive title
3. Give a description of the problem you encountered
4. Provide a link if it is on a specific page, images also help explain issues for people to fix
